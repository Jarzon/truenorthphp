How RESTful do we need to be, and where do we draw the line with a pragmatic approach to ship code and make our users happy? In this talk, I\'ll show how to build APIs that put into practice the concepts of REST, while showing that it\'s okay to bend or break the rules. Along the way, we\'ll cover the Richardson Maturity Model, hypermedia, when and where to use content negotiation, and API versioning pitfalls.',
