One in five of us will experience a diagnosable mental illness in the next year, but the stigma attached to it dissuades many from seeking help. These conditions will continue to take our siblings, parents, children, friends, and colleagues until we learn to talk about it without shame.
I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when I was thirteen, and I\'ve been struggling with it my whole life. In this talk, I\'ll discuss how it has impacted my work as a developer, husband, and father. We\'ll discuss how to help those who cope with mental illness as empathetic, supportive colleagues. Together, we\'ll change lives for the better. I gave this last year, but this has new content: more statistics, more impact on the workplace, and more "what can I do" info.',

      'text' => 'As developers, we usually focus on technical know-how as the measure of our ability. The best of us come up with solutions more quickly; solve harder and more complex problems; knows their language and platform intimately. That stuff is all useful, but I think we\'re measuring the wrong criteria. Technical competence is important, but at least as important is our ability to empathize, communicate, and reason beyond popular opinion. If we want to be great developers, we must value those skills just as highly as coding chops, because we need them to anticipate and solve our user\'s problems. In this talk, we\'ll examine why these non-technical skills have such an impact on us as developers, and how to apply them to our work.',
