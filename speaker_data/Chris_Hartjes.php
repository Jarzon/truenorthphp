  A huge consumer of open-source software, Chris tries to give back to the community via his blog, by speaking at conferences, and by co-organizing TrueNorthPHP. He is also a big believer in the power of testing and automation as secret weapons for organizations to deliver high quality applications quickly.

  He lives in Milton, Ontario, Canada with his long-suffering wife, two daughters, a furry pig masquerading as a cat, and the reincarnation of the Roman god of the underworld in feline form.',
