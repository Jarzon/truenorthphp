  'bio' => 'The first job I picked for myself as a very little kid was multi-generational space ship design for colonizing distant worlds.  I am still happy to pursue this line of work should anyone have any job openings for it.  Growing up and realizing this was a bit out of my reach due to my location in space-time, I started obsessing on what role I could fill in the getting-humanity-into-space mission.  The angle on the problem which called to me most was child rearing and education.  On examination it has always seemed to me that we would all have a whole lot more time, energy, and creativity with which to advance the species if we didn\'t spend so much time overcoming our rather slap dash upbringings and educations - so my goal in life became raising and educating children at a massive scale.  Then my spine was crushed and my ability to effect the universe became limited to what I can do through a laptop.  My interest in technology went from "everyone should learn technology so we can all go into space" to "the only effect I can have on the universe is through technology" and so for the last few years I\'ve been learning a lot about programming and making games that expand the mind as well as amusing the spirit.',

That said, if you\'re unfamiliar with a framework it can seem like all those benefits are on the other side of an obstacle course of unknown breadth and difficulty.  How long will it take you to get up to speed if you try to pick up a new Framework?  As long as that answer is an unknown quantity possibly equaling infinite, you\'re unlikely to take that leap.
This talk will include the basics of setting up a new project, understanding the file structure, getting a handle on the Routing-&gt;Controller-&gt;Template relationship, adding existing bundles to a project, and the basics of implementing Commands and Services.  Aimed at beginners who may have never used a framework before, this talk\'s goal is to equip you with all the information and understanding you need to skip the confusion and jump into developing with the Symfony2 framework.',
