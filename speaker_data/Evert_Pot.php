The promise is a bit hard to wrap your head around though. This talk will explain exactly how a promise works and behaves and how you should interact with it.
Next, we\'ll dig into generators. Generators have been added to PHP 5.5 and Ecmascript 6 and makes creating and consuming iterators a lot easier.
Generators have a unique language property though. They allow us to jump in the middle of any method outside that method. In the third part of the talk we\'ll show how we can use iterators to improve promise-heavy code and make asynchronous code look and behave as normal code.',
