      'text' => 'Using Model-View-Controller as a pattern to describe stateless HTTP interactions has always been a bit of a kludge. There simply hasn\'t been a better pattern web applications -- until now.  ADR (Action-Domain-Responder) represents a refinement of generic MVC as an application architecture specifically tuned to the web. In this talk, we will discuss various patterns of overall application architecture, including MVC, MVP, PAC, DCI, RMR, and others. We will find out how the ADR pattern arises from generic MVC, and how it provides a better description of how web applications actually work. Finally, we will go over examples of how to architect an ADR application, as well as how to convert from an MVC architcture to an ADR one.
