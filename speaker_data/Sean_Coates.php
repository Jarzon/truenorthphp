At Fictive Kin, we spend an embarrassingly large amount of money on AWS every month, and we use many of their services, so I\'ve become pretty good at pretending I know what\'s going on over there.
In this talk, we\'ll cover file hosting (S3), server hosting (EC2, VPC), DNS hosting (Route53), database hosting (RDS), and some additional things like Cloudwatch, CloudFront, and ElasticCache, but we\'ll focus on the moving parts of EC2.',
