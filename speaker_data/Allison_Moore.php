You may be tempted to throw some HTML up on your site and be done with it, but what happens when you need to update it down the road? What happens when you change a parameter and need to fix it in seven places? Grumpiness. Grumpiness is what happens. There is a better way.
This talk will show you how to figure out what docs you need to write, provide some strategies to improve your technical communication, and think through organizing your content. Then, we\'ll look at <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/tripit/slate">modern</a> <a href="https://github.com/mashery/iodocs">tools</a> you can use to render docs in a sane and maintainable way so that it\'s easy to keep them up-to-date as you improve and update. It doesn\'t have to be like pulling teeth, and it doesn\'t have to make you grumpy.
