After the introductions we move on to the meatier stuff and I will talk about live-action debuggers, such as Xdebug and Zend\'s debugger. They both provide information while a script is being executed, in combination with IDEs.
I am also unveiling a project that allows you to "step back" while debugging as well; introspect what your script\'s or application\'s exact execution paths was; and trace variable modifications.
