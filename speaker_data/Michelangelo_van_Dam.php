      'text' => 'So you have spent the last few years building ZF1 applications but now the business requirements have changed and you need to provide a full featured REST API. You could invest time, money and energy building it yourself, but have a look at Apigility. This is a full REST management application build on ZF2 allows you to tap into your existing ZF1 application and provide 100% REST endpoints to the outside world.
In this talk I go over the challenges we had to deal with creating our own REST implementation, throwing it all away because we only had 20% of the features of Apigility and setting up and managing Apigiltiy using our existing ZF1 application.
After this talk you will get a good understanding how to use Apigility to manage your REST APIâ€™s, while using your non-ZF2 application (Zend Framework, Symfony, Aura, â€¦). So you can invest time in building more features instead of trying to make your application REST compliant. I needed to architect APIâ€™s for customers who already had ZF1 applications and had already invested 4 months in developing a REST API, when Apigility was announced. We dropped all development and started investigating how we could integrate Apigility into our ZF1 applications. These findings are covered in this talk, I even blogged about it at dragonbe.com (http://www.dragonbe.com/2014/03/bootstrapping-zf1-application-in.html).',
