She also plays far too much with C based languages and has the superpower of breaking things, like valgrind and gdb, on the same day. She went to college for dance which quickly became an English major after the first baby. If you see her in person, ask how she wound up with a career in computers.',

Integrating a mental checklist and instilling some healthy "users are evil" paranoia can go a long way to keeping your site from becoming a victim. Learn about how to make the right decisions for the project that will keep your data safe without breaking the bank or the calendar, and how to add habits to your brain that will security consciousness part of your everyday programming habits.',

As with any implementation of a language, knowing some of the basics of the underlying code will allow you to deal with quirks, weirdnesses, and generally help you understand how you are communicating with the machine.
