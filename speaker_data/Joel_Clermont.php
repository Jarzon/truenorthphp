Property-based testing is a technique that can help you with this conundrum. Instead of writing a specific set of tests, write some generalized tests and let a tool randomly test inputs against your code.
I\'ll explain in more detail what property-based testing is, how it works, and show some practical examples using Eris, a new PHPUnit extension modeled after Haskell\'s QuickCheck library.',

It seems like there are n + 1 frameworks, where n is the number of Javascript developers. But how do you prevent a front-end application from getting fragile or complex as it grows in functionality? How can we increase the quality of our front-end application, yet retain simplicity in our code? And what about performance? Can we make our app fast as its complexity grows?
Enter Elm, a new language with a focus on building safe, reliable, well-architected and performant front-end applications. I will present an introduction to Elm, with a focus on what sets it apart from the myriad of other options available to the front-end developer. This talk will be very heavy on demos and examples, showing you the syntax, features, performance and tooling of the language. Ever see a time-traveling debugger? No? Then you won\'t want to miss this talk.',
