In addition, it allows for gradual adoption of these features and continued interoperability with existing PHP code. But why should you care? Do you need to work in a massive environment like Facebook to reap the rewards of learning a new language? I\'ll make a strong case that Hack (and HHVM) are worth your time, give you a good demo of the language and show you how to get started. I don\'t work for Facebook, but I dove into Hack the day it was announced and I\'ve continued to follow its development with great interest. I have applications in production running on Hack and I\'m eager to show PHP developers of all skill levels why it\'s worth their time to give Hack a look.',
