Do we really want the burden of maintaining credentials for other services for our users? Of course we don\'t! When a service provides an API for us to create and consume content, we want to trust that we can identify ourselves in the least intrusive way possible. OAuth allows us to make such requests securely, but it has a bad reputation for being difficult to implement and use. Never fear, this talk will break the protocol down into easy-to-understand steps, empowering you to provide your service, and use other services, with ease.',
