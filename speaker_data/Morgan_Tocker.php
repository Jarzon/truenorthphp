As part of this spring cleaning process, some features in MySQL 5.7 have a change in behaviour; for example the EXPLAIN PARTITIONS and EXPLAIN EXTENDED syntax will be enabled by default.  Other features will be deprecated and may be removed; for example the InnoDB Monitor tables.
This session aims to describe the motivations behind each of these changes and how they will affect you.',
