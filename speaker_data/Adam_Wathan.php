In this talk, you’ll find out what the real benefits of TDD are, what really makes code “good”, and why testability shouldn’t be your only yardstick for measuring code quality. I’ll also show you some of the pitfalls of a “purist” testing approach, and give you strategies you can use to test-first without sacrificing simplicity or expressiveness in your code.
If you’ve ever given up on testing because it seemed so hard to do everything “by the book”, this talk will feel like a breath of fresh air and give you the tools you need to start writing tests that really matter.',

In this talk, I\'ll walkthrough building a framework agnostic package. You\'ll learn about important OO design principles like dependency injection, interfaces, and encapsulation, and see how we can integrate our package with a modern framework like Laravel, or the messiest legacy codebase you\'ve ever seen.',
