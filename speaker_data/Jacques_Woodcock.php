Think Python’s virtualenv for PHP.
In this talk, co-creator Jacques Woodcock will introduce virtPHP and explain how it can benefit any PHP developer’s workflow. We\'ll also dive into the internals of virtPHP to see how it creates self-contained virtual environments. Finally, we\'ll discuss the project roadmap and how you can help. Talk can be reworked to be a tutorial as well.',
