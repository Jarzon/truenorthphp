She breathed more easily when he moved from hardware into programming, starting with BASIC. Jordan\'s experience includes multiple startups, companies large and small, and one large university. He contributes to a few open source projects and participates in local user groups, barcamps, and hackathons. Jordan\'s primary mission for over 10 years has been to use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to elevate web applications above their desktop rivals. He currently works as a Sr. JavaScript Engineer and Team lead for appendTo, a leader in front-end software solutions, specializing in JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5 and mobile development. In his down time he enjoys puzzles of all sorts and board games.',

This tutorial will guide attendees through the process of writing testable JavaScript code, setting up a testing framework, writing tests for that code, and some solutions for automating the entire process. We\'ll talk about some common issues such as asynchronous tests, anonymous functions, and automating tests that would normally require browser interaction.

Participants will come out of this session ready to implement and automate better tests for their JavaScript code on their own. They should come into this session with a solid understanding of basic JavaScript including basic variables, calling and writing functions, using callbacks, etc.; however, advanced knowledge is not required.',

More and more people are starting to realize how powerful this little language can be - start your re-education with this session and learn all about OOP in JS. First, we have to accept that while JavaScript may exhibit some characteristics of a functional language, it is really a multi-paradigm language with strong support for Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
This talk will give attendees a crash course in Object-Oriented JavaScript covering:
<ul>
<li>core OOP principles</li>
<li>the prototype object and constructors</li>
<li>member access types (public, private, &amp; privileged)</li>
<li>prototypical inheritance</li>
<li>interfaces (mixins)</li>
</ul>
Developers will come out of this session ready to implement core OOP concepts in JavaScript, with knowledge of how inheritance in JavaScript differs from many of the other languages they know.',
