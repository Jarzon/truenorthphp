Unfortunately, in software development, we don\'t have a utility belt. At best, our tools are scripts we\'ve cobbled together over the years that solve particular problems but leave us stuck more often than not. In this talk, we\'ll work to change that. I\'ll introduce you to seven tools that I find vital to my everyday API usage and development.',

And at the end of the day, we\'re still not sure it works. Instead, let\'s flip the entire experience around and look at it from the API consumer\'s point of view and confirm that we\'re solving real problems for real users.
