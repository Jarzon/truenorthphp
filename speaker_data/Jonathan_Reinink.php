      'text' => 'It\'s one thing to write a quick library that you and maybe a few coworkers will only ever use. It\'s an entirely different thing to put your work out there for the entire PHP community to analyze, test, poke, benchmark and critique. While there is potential for this process to be incredibly rewarding it can also be quite intimidating. Wouldn\'t it be nice to see what this looks like before you jump in? Come see how Plates (platesphp.com) became a thing last year while at the same time learning how to make your first open-source PHP package a success.
This talk comes from the perspective of a developer who has just gone through the process of releasing an open-source PHP project. As I share my personal story I plan to teach other developers what I learned along the way, and give practical advise on how they can successfully open-source their own PHP package. This talk includes a nice mix of soft skills and technical information, touching on many key areas of modern PHP development.
The main talking points are:
<ol>
<li>Why one might want to open-source a package</li>
<li>How to design an API that developers will actually WANT to use</li>
<li>The modern PHP coding standards needed to be taken seriously by other developers</li>
<li>How to market the package, including naming, documentation, design and getting the word out</li>
<li>Challenges around maintaining an open-source project, including navigating pull requests, backwards compatibility and more</li>
</ol>',
