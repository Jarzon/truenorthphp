We\'ve moved products from Ruby, Cold Fusion, and Symfony1.0, and even some Zend to a Symfony2.5 Service oriented architecture. We\'ve gone from terrible prototype.js hodge-podge scripts into using full blown client-side apps in Angular using Websockets and node.',

I will show you how my team has tamed JavaScript  and integrated our applications to connect to our PHP backends through RESTful API service with clean and abstracted code. I\'ll even show you how we swapped out the REST API to talk to a Node.js server that gets events from our PHP site, and how we connect our mobile app written in AngularJS with a Flash application running in IE8.',
