Are you asking questions like, "should I contribute to an existing project instead?" or "does the world really need yet another [insert your idea here]?" Maybe you are wrestling with, "am I good enough?" or "what if nobody wants to use it?" Once you decide to go for it, a whole new round of decisions need to be made like "which framework should I use?" , "should I roll everything from scratch?" or "should I use some standalone libraries to help me?" And this is before you\'ve even written any code!
