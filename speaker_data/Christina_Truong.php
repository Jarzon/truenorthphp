The projects ranged from creating front-end templates, mobile prototypes and web apps. My stint at a software company, Field ID, involved overhauling the in-house web app\'s front-end architecture and creating a customized framework.

These days I\'m independent but you can catch me at various Ladies Learning Code events around the country as lead instructor and now as Technical Lead. I also teach in Humber College\'s Web Design & Interactive Media Program.',
