The best communities exist because the users of a product or service banded together to make it happen, not because the company stood up a community site and invited people to start talking.
By the time users leave this talk, they\'ll understand what they and their companies can do to encourage communities to form around their products. Once the community forms, they\'ll have an understanding of how to cultivate it to encourage organic growth over forcing it to grow in a particular direction. Finally, attendees will leave this talk with an understanding of how to measure the success of their community efforts.',

We\'ll use Laravel\'s new micro-framework Lumen to build an API using all of the Laravel features we love without all of the full stack stuff we don\'t need. Once our API is set up, we\'ll look at consuming it via Laravel and delve into some SoA theory.
By the time attendees leave this talk, they\'ll have an overview of how they can use Lumen to create an API (from configuration to consumption) that they\'ll love to maintain and users will love to use. They\'ll also have an overview of API design best practices as well as a sprinkling of service-oriented architecture. The ideas conveyed in the talk will be demonstrated with a Laravel app that talks to a remote Lumen service.',
