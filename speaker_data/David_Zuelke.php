This workshop explores the benefits, characteristics, pitfalls and approaches of the platform, and walks the audience through the preparation and creation of applications, their configuration, and all the best practices and methodologies that will allow them to get the most out of Heroku upon their first deploy, from dependency management over development/production parity to scaling up (and down again).

For the brave ones, we\'ll sprinkle in some advanced Web server configuration, performance tuning and even a round of HHVM and Hack. I\'m expecting people to be familiar with Composer and Git already. Should be no problem for me to bring some platform credit vouchers for everyone, but the platform is free for hobby users anyway.',

But to fully leverage the power and convenience of PaaS offerings such as Heroku, it\'s worth following certain best practices and methodologies when developing applications. This presentation covers all the steps from code and dependency management over configuration to maintaining dev/prod environment parity, and will demonstrate, live on stage, just how easy it can be to deploy and scale a PHP application to the cloud.',
