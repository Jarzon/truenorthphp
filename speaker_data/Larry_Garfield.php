  'bio' => 'Larry Garfield has been building web sites since he was a sophomore in high school, which is longer ago than he\'d like to admit. As a freelancer he worked mostly for Chicago-area politicians before graduating to full time consulting with Palantir.net.
At Palantir, Larry is a Senior Architect and Consultant, developing solutions for medium to large cultural institutions. He also helps manage Palantir\'s internal development infrastructure.
Larry is an active Drupal core contributor, including the principle architect of the Drupal 7 database system and the Drupal 8 Web Services Lead. He is also a member of the Advisory Board of the Drupal Association. Larry holds a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from DePaul University.
Larry is a regular presenter at DrupalCons and DrupalCamps, frequently talking about software architecture. He is a co-author of "Drupal 7 Module Development" from Packt Publishing, and has also been published in Drupal Watchdog. He blogs at both http://www.palantir.net/ and http://www.garfieldtech.com/ and can be stalked on Twitter.',

In truth, functional programming is fundamentally an approach to software development, not a particular language or syntax. With PHP 5.3, it is an approach that is now more readily available and powerful than ever before. Even if you\'re not writing in Erlang or ML, there is still much to learn from the principles of functional programming to help write better code.
This session will discuss the history of functional programming and how it compares to other programming paradigms (procedural and object-oriented). We will then discuss by example how functional concepts and techniques, plus new language capabilities in PHP 5.3 such as anonymous functions can make our code more robust, maintainable, and bug-free. Even without a truly functional language, there is much we can learn from functional programming as a technique.',

Sucking at sharing is how Open Source dies.
PHP has long sucked at sharing. Cross-project collaboration was almost unheard of. Good reusable libraries were uncommon and hard to find. Leveraging 3rd party code was a hassle. Strong communities were isolated on their own islands.
That has changed, however. Years of work have brought a new promised land to PHP, and enabled cross-project cooperation like never before. It\'s a new world, and one with new cultural expectations.
This session will explore how the PHP industry has transitioned from a series of gated communities to an integrated, collaborative environment and how the cultural expectations around developing for PHP have shifted, and what that means for your project.',
