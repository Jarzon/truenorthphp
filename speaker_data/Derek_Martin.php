1) how Laravel works out of the box (feels full-stack like Cake/Rails)
- how to get a basic site up and running
   - built-in support for multiple environment configurations
   - creating routes
   - resource controllers &amp; restful controllers
   - eloquent ORM
   - making use of db migrations &amp; seeding
   - how Laravel tries to encourage testing
2) how to make Laravel work for you (it\'s component based, using composer)
