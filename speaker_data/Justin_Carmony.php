Learn how to solve traditionally difficult problems with Redis, and how you can benefit from 100,000 reads/writes a second on commodity hardware. We\'ll discuss how and when to use the different datatypes and commands to fit your needs. We\'ll discuss the different PHP libraries with their pros and cons. We\'ll then show some live examples on how to use it for a chatroom, and how Redis manages a billion data points for our dating matching system. Finally, we\'ll discuss some of the upcoming features in the near future, such as clustering and scripting.',

      'text' => 'While there are several popular configuration management tools such as puppet and chef, there is a new kid on the block: Salt. In this presentation we\'ll learn about how salt uniquely approaches remote execution and configuration management and just how fast it is. We\'ll show you how to get started up in minutes and easily manage multiple servers. Using Vagrant, in our tutorial we\'ll spin up several virtual machines and step-by-step walk through installation and setup. We\'ll show how to manage users, packages, services, files, and more. Finally, time permitting, we\'ll write some custom modules to extend salt to work with the specific needs of your application.

So come see why Salt is one of the fastest growing projects on GitHub, and why small startups and even large corporations are making the switch to salt.',
