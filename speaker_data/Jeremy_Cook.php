This talk will introduce ways that can help you to encapsulate the richness of your domain. We\'ll look at Action Domain Response as a new way of thinking about the concepts presented in MVC before examining Hexagonal Architecture, allowing you to easily reuse your domain across multiple delivery mechanisms. We\'ll then finish with an introduction to Domain Driven Design, a technique that allows you to closely align your domain with the business problems it is solving while helping keep things well designed and easily maintainable. By the end of this talk you should have the knowledge needed to begin modelling your domains more powerfully while keeping them aligned to the real world problems they solve.',
