You may have even tried Git to rebase something once (and remember getting kinda freaked out by the headless thing). You can follow along with the various tutorials you've found online. But now you've been asked to implement a work flow strategy for your company's next project and you're not really sure how (or where) to start.

In this session you will work closely with long-time version control lover Emma Jane Westby to create the perfect work flow strategy for each of your projects. This is a process workshop designed to help you sort through the pros and cons of different types of work flows. It is not a tutorial on how to run Git from the command line, it's a 10,000ft view of how your team works.

In this half-day workshop you will complete activities to help you determine the best permission and branching strategies for your team. We will also discuss how you can enforce your new workflow once you return back to your project. This workshop is appropriate for managers, and technical leads. This workshop was well received at OSCON in 2014, and php[tek] in 2013.",
