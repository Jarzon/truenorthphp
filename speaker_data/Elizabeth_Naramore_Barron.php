Those with toxic, closed communities will find it more difficult to be innovative, to attract contributors (and in some cases, users), and to keep up with expanding technologies. Because people are complex, diverse creatures, ensuring that your community is healthy, vibrant, and welcoming can be challenging.
The good news is, science can help you understand how people think and why they act the way they do. Knowing the effect your words and actions have on your fellow community members can guide the way you interact with, and shape the communities in which you\'re a member.
In this talk, we will discuss cognitive biases such as negativity bias, rejection sensitivity, in-group favoritism, illusion of transparency, and impostor syndrome. We will also talk about the neural and chemical affects of feeling misunderstood and disrespected, social bonding, and tribalism.
You\'ll come away from this talk with a better understanding of yourself and your fellow humans, an increased feeling of empathy, and the knowledge to improve personal interactions and your communities. ',
