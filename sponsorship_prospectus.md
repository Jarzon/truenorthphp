True North PHP Sponsorship Prospectus
=====================================

Thanks so much for your interest in sponsoring the 2015 True North PHP conference. For the past 3 years we have brought leading speakers from around the globe to Toronto. Everyone who attends has a great time and leaves with many new ideas.

With the help of generous donations from sponsors like you, this year's conference will be bigger and better. We are confident that we have sponsorship options that allow you to be a part of this year's event. 

Here are our plans for the event:

* a full day of tutorials
* 2 full days of talks 
* 3 tracks 
* 38 sessions 
* a themed hackathon
* fantastic social events
* Awesome time for everyone! 

In addition to the sponsorship levels listed below, we are also looking for sponsors to cover the costs of:

* coffee, beverages and pastries
* catered lunches
* social outings
* unique giveaway

If you have some unique ideas to combine your sponsorship with something unique, let us know. 

Further, should one of your employees get picked to speak and you can pay all their travel expenses, your company would automatically become a bronze level sponsor, allowing us to use the money that would have been allocated to their travel to bring in other exciting speakers!
