If you will be sticking around in the Greater Toronto Area after the conference is over there is a planned <a href="http://wurstcon.com/">WurstCon</a> outing for lunch on November 8th at <a href="http://www.wvrst.com/">WVRST</a>, a Bavarian-style German Beer Hall.
<br><br>
Space is likely to be limited so keep an eye on this page for how to reserve your place. This is not a official conference outing so WurstCon attendees will be expected to pay for their own meals and arrange transportation to the restaurant.
